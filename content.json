Nowadays, we just need to sign in the account through internet, we can chat with each other. Not only that, we can use video to see each other as truly communication. It’s much more convenient than before, but this feature doesn’t make the interpersonal networks closely than before. We increased our quality of life, but also decreased our humanity. I’m so curious what happened in nowadays world? &emsp;&emsp;Surfing on internet and open Facebook, a piece of photos and so many short words which are expressing someone’s feelings. You can see all of current situations of your friends and relatives. Even you have had a friend which lost contact for ten years, you still can use the various search method and “catch the line” with that friend. If you are lucky, you can contact with overseas people through these convenient networks and become the friends. Furthermore, you will be the member of internationalization. All steps sound like just need one finger. It seems like you caught a mouse and you caught the corner of interpersonal network. All of connections naturally become the “object of hand”, you can play it as you want between the hands. &emsp;&emsp;However, rapid transmission of information also caused rapid interpersonal conversion. I think perhaps it’s the attitude of “the most beautiful star is that one you can’t pick it.”. Something was hard-earned in the past, but now you can easily get it. That star which already holds on your hand is not shiny anymore and it will be discarded in the end. Moreover, people who had bad idea use internet to cheat some good people. In the ginormous networks, someone is pretending as your friends and family. You can’t recognize and verify, how to protect yourself? More and more frauds and criminal events make people stopping use internet to communicate with others because they don’t want to be the next victims. And some people talk very happy on internet, but they are speechless in the reality. Comparing the warm and lively talk in virtual with the silent in reality, this phenomenon make me unable to stop sighing and sobbing. People addicted with online unreal world and ignored people and things they should concern about in reality. In addition, people are growing further apart in reality and try to seek the new warm from internet, the vicious cycles trigger again and again and difficult to save. &emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, although convenient networks shorten the distance between people, but the distance of heart is far away than before. We don’t have truly personal experience in many things, many things are hard to understand if you just rely on touching the cold screen. For me, instead of waiting people in front of computer all day, I would rather to turn around to talk someone who was waiting for my reply. Internet is convenient and just for moderate using. After all, something can tighten interpersonal networks is your hand but not the little mouse you hold on.","categories":[{"name":"英文寫作","slug":"英文寫作","permalink":"https://tingsyuanwang.github.io/blogs/categories/英文寫作/"}],"tags":[],"keywords":[{"name":"英文寫作","slug":"英文寫作","permalink":"https://tingsyuanwang.github.io/blogs/categories/英文寫作/"}]},{"title":"HelloJS專案開發提議","slug":"HelloJS專案開發提議","date":"2016-08-30T12:55:48.000Z","updated":"2016-09-02T06:37:04.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/08/30/HelloJS專案開發提議/","link":"","permalink":"https://tingsyuanwang.github.io/blogs/blogs/2016/08/30/HelloJS專案開發提議/","excerpt":"","text":"(1) PokeHunt最近看到新聞，很多人玩寶可夢掉下懸崖、誤觸地雷區、甚至是在路上被車撞，我覺得我們是不是可以做一個偵測系統？大家有什麼方法可以提供一下？目前暫時只是概念性的解決問題，如果大家決定做這個就來討論一下細節。 (2) 翻轉文學聊天室在我大學時期有做一個翻轉文學的網站，我想說來做一點延伸，就是做聊天室、有全體的，還有同學個別對個別的，還有像是github issue一樣的討論區塊，這個我目前有些規劃，如果大家對即時條天有興趣我們可以做這個，這個的架構我就比較清楚要怎麼做，較好上手。 (3) 中草藥不良反應通報系統這是目前我在中國醫藥大學想做的專案，現在有很多中草藥的通報系統，但是目前卻沒有手機板的，而且填寫複雜，架構基本上已經定案，因為他有固定格式。因為我們學校跟衛生福利部的關係非常好，如果這個App有開發完成，我會盡力爭取上線，未來如果順利上線，可以跟政府申請一筆經費，看能不能跟大家來做大的？","categories":[{"name":"生活記事","slug":"生活記事","permalink":"https://tingsyuanwang.github.io/blogs/categories/生活記事/"}],"tags":[],"keywords":[{"name":"生活記事","slug":"生活記事","permalink":"https://tingsyuanwang.github.io/blogs/categories/生活記事/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2016-08-29T02:47:36.000Z","updated":"2016-09-02T06:36:41.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/08/29/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"https://tingsyuanwang.github.io/blogs/blogs/2016/08/29/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
